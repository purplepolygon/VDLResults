## What is the difference between the PCR and Antigen(Rapid) Test?

The PCR exam is sent out to the laboratory where it is sequenced. The PCR exam is the most conclusive exam and will definitively tell you whether or not you are positive for COVID-19. This generally takes 24 - 48 hours.
	
The Antigen(Rapid) test provides results in 10-15 minutes. This test is far less accurate and must ALWAYS be confirmed by a PCR exam per Doctor's guidelines. The test has what's called a 30% False Negative rate, meaning if you test POSITIVE on the Antigen test, you are positive. If you test Negative, then there is a 30% chance that you are actually positive.

## How do we interpret results from the PCR Exam?

A .PDF document will be sent to the patient's text messages. This document will indicate the following four outcomes:

**Detected** : This means that the patient is POSITIVE for COVID-19.
	
**Not Detected** : This mean that the patient is NEGATIVE for COVID-19.
	
**Inconclusive** : This means that the swab detected small amounts of COVID-19, but not enough to trigger a conclusive positive result. This can happen for a few reasons:
		
+ They are at the beginning stages of COVID-19 and don't have a high viral load
+ They are at the tail-end of a COVID-19 infection and don't have a high viral load
+ They did not get a good sample on their swab 
  
If they have inconclusive, they need to follow the same protocols as if they are positive and do a follow up test to definitively conclude their status.
	
**Invalid** : This could mean a myriad of reasons, ranging from paperwork not being filled out correctly, patients not putting the swab in the vial, lost vials, contaminated samples, error on the PCR machine, or just about any other reason. In this case, they need to retest.

## Is this test valid for travel?
	
Yes, this test is valid for travel, however every airline and countries policies differ. It is important to note that this is a free exam so we do NOT guarantee results. If they need guaranteed results they can always go to our Doctor's office located at 250 La Cienaga Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90211. It is $180 for 6-12 hours, $150 for 12-24 hours guaranteed results.

## Are we partnered with Los Angeles County?

Yes, we are officially partnered with Los Angeles County. You can view our partnered testing sites at the Los Angeles COVID-19 website found here: https://covid19.lacounty.gov 

## What needs to be filled out on the forms?

Each requisition form needs to have the following information:

+ First name
+ Last name
+ Date of Birth - Always check that they put the month first, followed by the day, followed by the year. A lot of countries write the day first instead of the month.
+ Date of test
+ Address - If patient declines to use an address or has no address, you may always put the address of the site that you are at. Alternatively you may always use Sunset and Western's address:
	
> 5525 Sunset Blvd.
> Los Angeles, CA 90028
+ Phone number - This must be a U.S. Cell phone number, as they will receive their results via text message containing a .PDF document.

If they only have an international phone number and no e-mail address, what you will do is put the following number in the field: 424-566-2614 You will then on a separate piece of paper write the following information:

+ Name
+ Date of Birth
+ Day of Test
+ E-mail Address
  
At the end of the day, you will send a text message with a picture of this piece of paper to 424-566-2614, and the following day she will send their results via e-mail.
	
+ E-mail - This field is optional.
  
+ Insurance information:
  
  > If they have insurance, they need to write the name of the provider, the insurance/ID number, and group number if they have it.
	
  > If they have Medi-Cal, they will write their Medi-Cal number in the Medi-Cal box.
	
  > If they have Medicare, they will write their Medicare number in the Medicare box.
	
  > If they have insurance but don't know their number, they need to write the name of their insurance and fill out an uninsured form as well. You will need to capture their drivers license number.
    
+ Signature
  
+ Date
	

If they do NOT have insurance, or they are from out of town, they will also need to fill out the 2nd uninsured requisition form. Capture driver's license number as much as possible, and make sure they sign and date.

## How do I fill out the vials?

You will write their first name and last name if it fits, as well as their date of birth. If their name is long you may also use first name and last initial instead.

## What if a patient did not receive their results?

In this case they will need to send a text message with their name, date of birth, and day they were tested to 424-566-2614. Our results person will then send them their results.

## Can I test myself?
	
Yes. We are all required to test ourselves Friday in order to keep ourselves and our coworkers safe and healthy. 

## Can I test my friends and family?

Absolutely. Please help keep your friends and families safe by having them test once a week.

## Is this test free?

Yes. This test is free for all who come and test. If they do not have insurance, Medicare/Medi-Cal picks it up. If they are from out of town, Medicare/Medi-Cal also picks it up. If they have insurance, they will need to write their insurance information on the form. All insurance companies including Medi-Cal/Medicare are required by law to provide free testing at least once a week.

## How much does the Antigen test cost?

The Antigen/Rapid test costs $75. They will receive their results in 10-15 minutes alongside a requisition form stating their outcome as either positive or negative.
	
By the Doctor's orders, due to the inaccuracy of the Rapid/Antigen test all Antigen results must be confirmed with a PCR examination. They must complete both tests in order to receive their Antigen results.

## What if somebody asks if I can do at-home testing?

You may accept this offer if you'd like. Generally this happens with elderly patients or disabled patients. You may not clock in for this service; however, you can generally charge between $50-$150 for this service depending on amount of people that need to be tested. You can set your own rate and keep the amount they give you. Bring the tests with you the following day.

## How long does it take to receive results?

Generally you receive results in 24 - 48 hours. We can not ship to our lab past 5:00 p.m. on Saturdays or on Sundays as we use FedEx Overnight in order to ship off results. Those tests will be processed the following Monday, so in that case they will receive their results in 48 - 72 hours.

## Do we test minors or babies?

Yes. We test people of all ages from 1 day old to 100+ years!
